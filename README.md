# Overview
`ABCLLM` is a comprehensive framework for training, fine-tuning, and using large language models (LLMs). The repository implements both GPT-style and Llama3-style transformer architectures with supporting infrastructure for efficient training, data processing, model management, and text generation.

# Purpose and Scope
This repository provides a modular and extensible platform for working with transformer-based language models with the following core capabilities:

* Implementation of transformer-based model architectures (GPT, Llama3)
* Training infrastructure with support for distributed training
* Flexible dataset processing for various training scenarios
* Multiple tokenization options
* Model checkpoint management
* Text generation with sampling controls
